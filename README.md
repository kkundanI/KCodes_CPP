# KCodes_C++ :
 ðŸ‘‹ Hi,ðŸŽ‰ I'm excited to have you here!
  
Welcome to my **KCodes_C++** repository! This repository contains a collection of C++ programs that I have written while and after learning C++ programming. It is divided into four derectories:

* **Usual:**
  > This folder contains all of the codes that were discussed and taught in my C++ course.
* **Useful:**
  > This folder contains codes that are rarely taught but can be used in larger programs or projects. These codes can save you time and effort when developing your own C++ projects.
* **Unusual:**
  > This folder contains unusual programs that I wrote out of curiosity. These programs are not typically taught in C++ courses, but they are interesting and challenging to write.
* **Assignments:**
   > This folder contains all of the programs that I wrote for my semester assignments.




I hope that you find this repository useful and informative. Please feel free to use any of the code in your own projects, and please contribute your own code if you have any!

### Additional information:

* I am still learning as a programmer, so my code may not be perfect. Please feel free to suggest improvements or corrections.
* If you have any questions about my code, please feel free to ask. I am always happy to help others learn .
* I am always looking for new and interesting programs to write. If you have any ideas, please let me know!

I hope you enjoy my C++ repository!
